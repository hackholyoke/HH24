## What This Application Does

### Frontend

- Speakers
- Project tracks
- The schedule
- Featured answers and questions
- An introduction to the organizing team

### Testing

This application uses **Jest** to test React components.

### Backend

A registration form is implemented on the frontend, and work is in progress to set up the backend database.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** & **React.js**
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **Jest** (for testing)
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Node.js**

## Challenges Faced and Future Implementation Ideas

### Challenges

- **Project Leadership and Mentoring**: I led the project and mentored a team while learning front-end technologies.
- **Responsive CSS**: The goal of the project was to create an immersive, creative user experience, and there were few CSS templates to work from. The responsive design was developed from scratch using basic CSS.
- **File Management and Clean Code**: A challenge arose when rendering components with overlapping class names. This bug has been fixed.
- **Adding a Backend**: I am currently learning backend technologies to integrate the database with the frontend.

### Future Implementation Ideas

- **User Login Feature**: Allow users/participants to create and manage accounts.
- **Project Submission Form**: Enable users to submit their projects directly on the platform.
- **Participant Dashboard**: Provide a dashboard for participants to view their projects and judge feedback.
